# ObjectDetetion
This is the place to store the code of objection detection, which include faster rcnn with keras
The files came from https://github.com/you359/Keras-FasterRCNN, but I made some updates.
(1) At pretrain part, I just keep two Conv networks (vgg and resnet)
(2) The "OptionParser" function is optional.
